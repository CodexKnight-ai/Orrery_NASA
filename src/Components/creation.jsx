            Formation of the Solar System
            <br />
            The Solar System formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a massive cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. This nebula was likely triggered to collapse by a shock wave from a nearby supernova, which compressed certain cloud regions. As the nebula collapsed under its gravity, it spun and flattened into a disk shape. The centre of this disk accumulated most of the material, forming the Sun, while the remaining material in the disk began to coalesce into planets, moons, asteroids, and other celestial bodies.</p>
            <p>Accretion Process
            <br />
            The formation of planets occurred through a process called accretion. In this process, tiny dust grains within the protoplanetary disk collided and stuck together, forming larger clumps. Over time, these clumps grew into larger bodies known as planetesimals, which could reach sizes of several kilometres in diameter. As these planetesimals continued to collide and merge, they formed protoplanets. This gradual accumulation allowed for the formation of terrestrial planets—like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—in the warmer inner regions of the Solar System and gas giants—like Jupiter and Saturn—in the cooler outer regions.</p>
            <p>Temperature Variations and Planet Types
            <br />
            The temperature gradient within the protoplanetary disk was crucial in determining the types of planets that formed. In the inner Solar System, temperatures were too high for lighter gases to condense; thus, rocky planets formed primarily from heavier elements like iron and silicates. Conversely, in the outer regions where it was cooler, gases such as hydrogen and helium could condense, allowing for the formation of larger gas giants. This differentiation clearly distinguished terrestrial planets (rocky) and gas giants (gaseous), influencing their composition and structure.</p>
            <p>Formation of Moons and Other Bodies
            <br />
            As planets formed, they also gathered surrounding material that contributed to the creation of moons. For example, many of Jupiter's moons likely formed from the same disk of material that surrounded them during their formation. Additionally, leftover debris from planet formation became asteroids and comets. The Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter contains remnants that never coalesced into an entire planet due to Jupiter's strong gravitational influence. Comets originate from regions farther out in the Solar System, such as the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud</p>
            <p>Clearing of Residual Material
            <br />
            Once nuclear fusion ignited in the Sun’s core, it emitted intense solar winds that blew away much of the remaining gas and dust in the protoplanetary disk. This process helped to clear out residual material that could have otherwise contributed to further planet formation. The solar wind also played a role in shaping the orbits of planets by affecting their angular momentum during their early development stages.</p>
